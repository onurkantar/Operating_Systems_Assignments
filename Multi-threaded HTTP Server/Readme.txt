Multi-threaded HTTP Server

Due date : 9 December 2018, 11:59 pm (No extension, please do not request!!)

Task
In this assignment, you are expected to write a small web server in c that supports a
subset of the HTTP 1.0 specifications. The server;
• should be able to handle simultaneous requests
• implement the HTTP methods GET and HEAD
• handle and respond to invalid requests.
You should be able to demonstrate that your Web server is capable of delivering your
home page to a Web browser. You should implement version 1.0 of HTTP, as defined in
RFC 1945, where separate HTTP requests are sent for each component of the Web page.
The server will be able to handle multiple simultaneous service requests in parallel. This
means that the Web server is multi-threaded. In the main thread, the server listens to a
fixed port. When it receives a TCP connection request, it sets up a TCP connection
through another port and services the request in a separate thread.
To simplify this programming task, we will develop the code in two stages. In the first
stage, you can write a multi-threaded server that simply displays the contents of the
HTTP request message that it receives. After this program is running properly, you can
add the code required to generate an appropriate response.
As you are developing the code, you can test your server from a Web browser, such as
Chrome, Safari, Firefox web browser as http client application. But remember that you
are not serving through the standard port 80, so you need to specify the port number
within the URL that you give to your browser. For example, if your machine's name is
testhost.mydomain.com your server is listening to port 6789, and you want to retrieve
the file index.html, then you would specify the following URL within the browser:
http:// testhost.mydomain.com:6789/index.html
If you omit ":6789", the browser will assume port 80 which most likely will not have a
server listening on it.
When the server encounters an error, it sends a response message with the appropriate
HTML source so that the error information is displayed in the browser window.
